# Metric Design and Retention Analysis on a Job Posting Board Dataset

I tried to answer the following questions given all the data. For the answers please check the 'Glassdoor Test Answers.pdf'

Q - What metrics do you propose to measure the quality of services Glassdoor provided to our clients?  How does performance vary in terms of:
    - Job_Slots?
    - Total_Contract_Value?
    - Click_Market_Value?
    
Q - What factor or combination of factors best predict likelihood to retain (i.e., Renewal_Flag = 1)? List out any assumptions in the modeling process and explain why you chose your methodology.

Q - How well does your analysis in #4 predict retention?  What other factors might you want to investigate to see if they could improve your analysis?

Q - What modifications would you recommend we make to our ad platform algorithm to improve retention?

#1 - 'Glassdoor test Answers.pptx' 
--> Powerpoint presentation includes all the answers for the assignment questions. Thesame file has also been exported to pdf file.
--> One thing to note is that the SQL queries from first 2 questions was done in Google Bigquery SQL so some the functions such as Date_add differs in standard SQl as DATEADD.  

#2 'GDoor.twb'
--> Tableau file contains visualizations which are already included in the pptx.

#4 'Glassdoor_Test_Analysis.ipynb'
--> The jupyter notebook for all pre-processing and final algorithm.
